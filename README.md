# Odin Recipes
This project represents my submission for the first submission based assignment of The Odin Project, specifically the Foundations portion of the course.

Whilst the complete course covers full stack development, this particular assignment only covers the basics of html and css. For these reasons it shouldn't be used to gauge the quality of my work. To do that I recommend you check out the pinned repositories on my github page.
